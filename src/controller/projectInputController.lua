-- The project route: owner of the input handlers while a
-- project run owns the screen — a sibling to
-- ConsoleController / EditorController. The route is DUMB:
-- it navigates every
-- event, keyboard and pointer alike, through THREE consumers in
-- order, stopping at the first that returns truthy
-- (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-CHAIN-OF-3):  1.
-- compy.input.shortcuts[event][combo]  project shortcut combos
-- (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-COMBO-TABLES:
-- per-event sub-tables, normalising) 2.
-- compy.input.hooks[event]             one hook per event
-- (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-HOOKS-SEEDED): the
-- single source of truth, seeded once at activate() with the
-- project's captured love.* handler where unset; a nil clears
-- with no resurrection 3. the widget
-- terminal; consumes whenever it is shown (its own internal
-- flag), skipped when hidden. Enter/Escape/submit/cancel are
-- the WIDGET's own business (userInputController), signalled
-- via callbacks — never a routing concern.  Truthy at a
-- consumer stops the walk; falsey falls through. The widget's
-- participation derives from its shownness, not a return
-- value (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-CHAIN-OF-3;
-- outcomes travel by callback, D-EDIT-CALLBACKS). Routing
-- contract: doc/development/internals/user_input.md

-- Every channel the chain dispatches on, in ONE list. The
-- derived clicks belong in it: where an event comes from
-- (LÖVE, or the framework's click timer) is not how a
-- project binds
-- it, and the seeder has to see the same channels the
-- dispatcher installs.

}

-- What a channel names as its combo trigger, read off LÖVE's
-- own arguments. Keyboard and text name their first; the two
-- button channels name their third, serialised as 'mouseN' so a
-- combo reads the same way whatever the trigger is — 'ctrl+s'
-- and 'ctrl+mouse2' are one vocabulary, not two. A channel
-- absent here has no discrete trigger to name and matches on
-- held modifiers alone ('ctrl+*').

--- A project's own `love.keypressed` was written under LÖVE's
--- convention, where assigning a channel means owning it and
--- there is nothing to propagate to — so its return value
--- says nothing about consumption and must not decide it.
--- Seeded handlers therefore consume unconditionally; a hook
--- the project wrote into `compy.input.hooks` keeps the
--- chain's truthy convention, its author being presumed to
--- know it (doc/development/decisions/input.md,
--- D-HOOKS-SEEDED, "A seeded handler consumes" — the named
--- exception to D-CHAIN-OF-3). Nil in, nil out: an unset
--- channel stays unset, which is information a project reads

--- table is the single source of truth — a nil'd hook clears,
--- with no resurrection. Runs after the project's top-level

--- Exact combo first, then the modifier class
--- (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-COMBO-SHAPE): 'alt+*'
--- is every Alt chord. The class key needs no parsing — it is
--- the same serialisation with '*' as the trigger. A modifier's
--- own press names no shortcut at all: no combo with a modifier
--- as its trigger is registrable (check_combo folds every
--- token, finds no trigger and raises), so the guard comes
--- first and neither lookup is built.
---
--- A channel with no trigger to name (mousemoved, wheel, touch,
--- the derived clicks) can only have the class key: 'ctrl+*' is
--- a ctrl-drag. With no modifier held there is nothing to name
--- and the event belongs to the hook — which is why the
--- held-modifier test comes first, so an unmodified mousemoved
--- never allocates a combo string.

--- The three-consumer walk: shortcuts[event][combo] →
--- hooks[event] → widget, stopping at the first that
--- consumes.
--- A shortcut or hook consumes by returning truthy; the widget
--- consumes whenever it is shown (its own internal flag), and
--- is skipped when hidden — so the walk reports consumed
--- iff a consumer fired or the widget was shown. A free
--- function over
--- plain tables + a widget reference, so any adopter (not only
--- the project widget) can reuse it over its own instance. The
--- nil guards are deliberate (D-NO-LOG-NOISE): whether a hook
--- is set is information a project reads, so an unset one stays
--- nil rather than defaulting to a callable noop. Nothing is
--- logged when an event is consumed by nobody either — that
--- would be a line per ordinary keystroke at this tier.
